**MaskDINO Panoptic Segmentation on Google Colab**

This is my implementation on panoptic segmentation using MaskDINO. The original MaskDINO github available here: https://github.com/IDEA-Research/MaskDINO

What you'll need to prepare:
1. Panoptic segmentation dataset that includes images, COCO Panoptic JSON annotations, and PNG mask annotations.
2. Instance segmentation JSON annotations related to the panoptic segmentation dataset.
3. All datasets and annotations are to be uploaded to Google Drive for easy copy in Google Colab.
